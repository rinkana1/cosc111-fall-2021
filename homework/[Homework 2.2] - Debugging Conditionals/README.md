## Debugging Tasks:

Each task contains some code that either fails with some error, or produces the wrong result when run.

1. Look at the code in **main.py** and run it (with various inputs) to figure out what's going wrong.
2. Fix the code.
3. Then, leave a comment above the code explaining what was wrong with it and how you fixed it.

**Hints:**

* Remember the different kinds of errors: *Syntax* erros, *Runtime* errors, and *Semantic* errors. The semantic errors are often the most difficult to uncover.
* Consider different input values. What happens when you try different inputs? What behavior is expected with various inputs?
* Feel free to add temporary additional print statements to look at intermediate results.
* You must pass all the tests. Does having tests help you uncover errors?

**NOTE:** Remember to test your code before submitting!

There are unit tests to run for each homework. To make it automated, each unit test looks for the exact output expected for each task. Makes sure all unit tests pass before submitting your homework.

**Important:** You will be graded for completing the tasks as instructed. Not only do the test cases have to pass, but we will check over the code to see that you followed directions.
