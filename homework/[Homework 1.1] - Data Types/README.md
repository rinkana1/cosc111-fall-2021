# Introduction to Homework

In this course, homework assignments will usually look something like this. There will be a list of tasks, each with instructions. Your job is to go over to **main.py** and complete each task underneath its label.

Here's an example solution to a made-up task:

    # Example Task: Print the result of 10 divided by 5
    print(10 / 5)
    
When you've finished this assignment, you should have a lot of lines in **main.py** that look something like the above.

# 

**NOTE:** For these tasks, you should not be doing **any arithmetic** in your head or on a calculator (except to check your work). Python should be doing all of the computations for you. This means that each print() in your code should have at least one of the following symbols in it: +, -, \*, /, //, %. 

**NOTE:** Remember to test your code before submitting!

There are unit tests to run for each homework. To make it automated, each unit test looks for the exact output expected for each task. Makes sure all unit tests pass before submitting your homework.

## Numbers, Data Types

### Task 1: Print Sum

**Instructions:**
Fill in the print statement so that the computer calculates and prints the sum of the numbers 11, 14, and 17.

# 

### Task 2: Print Hours

**Instructions:**
Fill in the print statement so that the computer calculates and prints the total number of hours in a year, by multiplying the number of hours in a day by the number of days in a year.

# 

### Task 3: Repeating Greeting

**Instructions:**
Fill in the print statement so that the computer prints the string "Hello" multiplied by the number 11. *Does the output surprise you?*

# 

### Task 4: Convert String to Float

**Instructions:**
Modify the code to covert the string value to a float and print the type as:

     <class 'float'>

#

### Task 5: Un-stringify 

**Instructions:**s
Modify the code to print out the correct sum of the two numbers instead of concatinating the strings--WITHOUT removing the quotes. That is, the code should print:

    16

instead of:

    124
