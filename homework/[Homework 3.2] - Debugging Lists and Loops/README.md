# Homework 2.2 - Lists and Loops

## Debugging Tasks:

Each task contains some code that either fails or produces the wrong result when run.

1. Look at the code in **main.py** and run it (with various inputs) to figure out what's going wrong.
2. Fix the code.
3. Then, leave a comment above the code explaining what was wrong with it and how you fixed it.

**Hints:**

* Remember the different kids of errors: *Syntax* erros, *Runtime* errors, and *Semantic* errors. The semantic errors are often the most difficult to uncover.
* Consider different input values. What happens when you try different inputs? What behavior is expected with various inputs?
* Feel free to add extra print statements to look at intermediate results.
* You must pass all the tests. Does having tests help you uncover errors?

# 

### Task 1

Given the already defined list of things to do, print out the very first item as so:

    The first thing to get done is: <first_item>

#

### Task 2

Given the already defined list of grades. Print each item out, one per line.

#

### Task 3

Get as input from the user how many people. Then have the user enter (as input) each person's name, and store them in a list.

Finally, print out each person's name, one per line.

#

### Task 4

Get as input from the user how many numbers they will enter. Then have the user enter in (as input) each number. 

Output the result of multiplying every number together and print the final result as:

    Total Multiplication: <result>

**Example 1**

    How many numbers? 4
    Enter number: 5
    Enter number: 2
    Enter number 5
    Enter number 10
    Total Multiplication: 500

**Example 2**

    How many numbers? 3
    Enter number: 111
    Enter number 0
    Enter number 34
    Total Multiplication: 0

**Example 3**

    How many numbers? 0
    Total Multiplication: 0
