# Lab 2 - Choose Your Own Adventure!

## Instructions
You and your group will design and program a *Choose Your Own Adventure Game*! This is purely a text-based adventure game where the player progresses to different scenerios based on their ability to choose from a limited set of choices. 

You must provide the player at least 2 different choices in at least 2 different parts of the adventure.

* Think about what those choices will be. For example, the program could prompt the user to choose which door to enter, or choose which enemy to fight, or choose which treasure chest to open, or which item to select.
* Think about how those choices will be presented to user (via the terminal), and how the user's choice will be retrieved and stored.
* Think about how to use conditionals (if/else statements) to change what scenerios/outcomes are presented to user.

## Example Game Playthrough:
Here is an example of a game I created. I'll show two different playthroughs, and take note on how the output changes based on the choices made:

**Play Through 1:**

    Welcome to choose your own adventure game!
    What is your name? Derrall

    Alright Derrall, choose your weapon!

     0 - Axe
     1 - Sword
     2 - Bow & Arrow
     3 - Spear

    0
    Ah the Axe, slow but powerful!


    Who will you battle first?

     0 - The Ogre
     1 - The Harpy
     2 - The Knight

    0
    You killed the Ogre! Only super long range or powerful close range weapons could do the job!

    The End!

    Arggh! The Harpy dropped huge rocks on your head. You couldn't reach her with your sword. You dead.

    The End!
